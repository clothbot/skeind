Outline of the Object Oriented Structure:

- Mesh
	- is composed of triangles
	- sorts triangles from Z- to Z+ order
		- subsorts triangles from Y- to Y+
			- subsorts triangles from X- to X+
	- has a bounding cube
	- detects degenerate Triangle
		- zero-area
	- can be constructed from ModelSlices
- Line3D
	- is made of two Vector3D points
	- has a Vector3D absolute start position
		- allows for 
	- has a Vector3D end position relative to the start position
- Triangle
	- is made of three Vector3D points
		- first point is min Z 
			- subsort to min Y 
				- subsort to min X
		- last point is max Z 
			- subsort to max Y 
				- subsort to max X
	- has properties
		- has a Vector3D normal
	- has functions
		- calculate2DArea
		- Line3D calculate3DBCube
		- intersectPlane
- Slice
	- is a QPainterPath
	- has properties (read-only direct access)
		- has a thickness
		- has a bounding box
			- local (untransformed)
		- has a QVector3D position
		- has a QVector3D orientation
		- has a QTransform transform
			- resize 2D content
		- has a gridScaleX, gridScaleY
			- quantize data for grid-snap, machine limitations, etc.
	- has functions
		- get2DBBox (transformed 2D bounding box)
		- get3DBCube (transformed, oriented bounding cube)
		- setPosition
		- setOrientation
		- setTransform
		- setThickness
	- has 2D operators
		- geomOr()
			- equiv to OpenSCAD union or QPainterPath united()
			- Slice geomOr(Slice first, QList<Slice> rest)
			- Slice geomOr(Slice first, Slice rest)
			- default properties inherited from first.
		- geomAnd()
			- equiv to OpenSCAD intersection() or QPainterPath intersected()
			- Slice geomAnd(Slice first, QList<Slice> rest)
			- Slice geomAnd(Slice first, Slice rest)
			- default properties inherited from first.
		- geomAndNot()
			- equiv to OpenSCAD difference() or QPainterPath subtracted()
			- Slice geomAndNot(Slice first, QList<Slice> rest)
			- Slice geomAndNot(Slice first, Slice rest)
			- default properties inherited from first.
		- geomXor()
			- Slice geomXor(Slice first, QList<Slice> rest)
			- Slice geomXor(Slice first, Slice rest)
			- default properties inherited from first.
		- shell()
			- Slice shell(qreal wallThickness)
